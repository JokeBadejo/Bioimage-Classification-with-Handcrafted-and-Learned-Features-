Main functions:
CLMfeature.m
%It explains how to use CLM feature extractor and to train SVM in the two ways described in the paper

MainTestsSurveyBiologicalSuite.m
%It explains how to extract the different local features tested in the paper 

%the code for the deep learning approaches is available from the related papers:
a) ToolDeepFeatures.rar, Loris Nanni, Stefano Ghidoni, (2016) How could a subcellular image, or a painting by Van Gogh, be similar to a great white shark or to a pizza?, Pattern Recognition Letters
b) ToolDeepTransfer.rar. Loris Nanni, Stefano Ghidoni, Sheryl Brahnam (2017) Handcrafted vs Non-Handcrafted Features for computer vision classification, Pattern Recognition

%Notice that before the fusione the scores are normalized to 'mean=0' and 'standard deviation = 1':



NOTICE THAT THIS CODE IS NOT EXACTLY THE SAME USED IN OUR PAPERS
WE TRY TO POLISH IT AND TO MAKE IT EASIER TO READ
WE CHECK THE CODE BUT WE HAVE NOT RERUN ALL THE TESTS
SO SOME ERRORS ARE ALWAYS POSSIBLE
